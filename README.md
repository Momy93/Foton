# Foton
Foton is a sort of (unfortunately the real ones don't exist yet) lightsaber, which can monitor temperature and humidity of a room, detect movements, and send those data to a smartphone.
This repo contains the source code of the Android app.
The intruction for building the divice and the explanation of the code are available on the [Hackster page](https://www.google.com) of the project.
